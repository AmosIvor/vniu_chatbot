**Description**:

The chatbot is built on the Rasa framework, designed to assist users with their shopping and service-related queries in an intelligent and efficient manner. Rasa, an open-source machine learning framework for building AI chatbots, powers the natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management components of the chatbot. This enables it to understand user intents, manage conversations, and provide relevant responses.

**How to use**:

1. Clone the respository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmosIvor/movie_server.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie_server
```

3. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate virtual environment you just created

- On Windows:

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run the following commands in two separate terminal windows:

- Start the Rasa shell for interacting with the chatbot:

```bash
rasa shell
```

- Start the Rasa action server to handle custom actions:

```bash
rasa run actions
```
